  Hi!<br>
  These posts are just quick notes that I have taken that I wanted to be made more
  accessible to me or to anyone else who wants them. I make no promises about their
  quality, so use at your own risk. <a
  href="/notes/Automatically_uploading_notes">This post</a> shows how
  I upload my notes to this website automatically.
</p>

{% for note in site.notes %}

<article class="post-preview">
  <a href="{{ note.url | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }}">
    <h2 class="post-title">{{ note.title }}</h2>
    {% if note.subtitle %}
    <h3 class="post-subtitle">{{ note.subtitle }}</h3>
    {% endif %}
  </a>
  <p class="post-meta">Posted by
    {% if note.author %}
    {{ post.author }}
    {% else %}
    {{ site.author }}
    {% endif %}
  </p>
</article>
